Patch matching loss is for when we want to apply the style of hair to content hair. Helps if images aren't aligned. Not interesting for me.



~~~~~~~~ Ideas ~~~~~~~~
Local style transfer
  Match the style vector with the content vector per feature map pixel so that the style isn't transfered globally
  Style loss (gram matrices) sort of represents the global similarity, so a thing from bottom left spills over to top right. This is good if you want to have the general feel of an image transfer over to another, but not so good if you do harmonization as local information is important. Maybe gram-matrices on subregions could be used. Could be computationally expensive.

Fast style transfer
  Train feed forward network to create approximation of stylized image. In contrast to optimize ONE image
